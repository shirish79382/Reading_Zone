# Reading_Zone

# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
One of the major problems we face nowadays is encompassed by fake unverified news. In the era of various social media platforms news(especially spicy fake news ) is blown away rapidly without any authorized verification. There is no such apps built yet to verify the authentication of the news at the time it is being posted, and sometimes it becomes too late and sometimes the effects can be really major.


# PROPOSED SOLUTION: 
*This is an open-source application that contains a field called "READING ZONE" to the users where people can read verified information. 
*Here users basically have to choose their 'community' after a login page. Users can even sort the news based on the time and date it has been published.
*Besides the reading part users can also add news. But the news will not be on public view until and unless it is verified by the authority.
*This will only contain the information which is verified.


# Functionality & Concepts used :

The App has a very simple and interactive interface that helps the users to select their community-based interested topics. Following are a few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the app :
Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for users to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. This app also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.

Navigation Library: Navigation occurs between your app's destinationsâ€”that is, anywhere in your app to which users can navigate. 


LiveData & Room Database: We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the information received from their mobile in real-time and update it to local databases using Room. Thus the app data is always updated and verified.

Linear Layout: LinearLayout is a view group that aligns all children in a single direction, vertically or horizontally. You can specify the layout direction with the android: orientation attribute.

View Model: The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

Fragment: A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle and can handle its own input events.


# FUTURE SCOPE:
 Once fully tested, our aim is to make the app available on Google play store and Appstore. We aim to create an open-source platform for people of all communities for sharing the information on different topics they have in a verified form. Our viewers will also be able to like as well as share the information which is being posted in the "READING ZONE".
